# XApps
High usage Extension framework used for multi-purpose applications, with many utility classes for ease of programming

# How to use it
Xapps is essentially an abstracted layer of a basic WinForms application, allowing you to create applications with dynamic graphics with ease. It also contains other Modules that take standard processes and cut down the programmer workload. This will be explained in further detail later.

The main classes you interact are contained in src/Base. As a user of the .dll, you will be interacting with:

**XApp**
**XBase**
**XSession**

you will also be using src/Graphics/XWindow frequently. This will be explained in more detail later on.
